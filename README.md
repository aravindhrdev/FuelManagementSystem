# This Project is part of Academic Professional Training(PT) 5th Semester Paper

__NOTE:__

1.The Project might have exceeded the limitation of 500 lines of code as total (As specified by the Project Head) . Considering the functional code in the backend including events,API route files and socket connection , the 500 lines restriction mark was unable to cope with.  

2.Unavoidably to implement two features :  
i. Real-Time Transaction monitoring and  
ii. Automated Stock Request and Monitoring , frontend plays key role in displaying the features, hence the implementation took extra lines.  

3.The code follows ESX Syntax of JavaScript and follows Sonarlint conventions as developed in VSCODE IDE.  
  
4.Additional Features (Future Scope) : Downloading of latest transactions and restock requests branchwise or according to duration limits, Eg.1 hour,10 hours and 1day etc.., in a structured format (JSON or CSV) for analysis.
